    <p>
    The Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is an invasive species in the Great Lakes native to the Atlantic Ocean. They first appeared in Lake Ontario in the 1870s, and spread to Lake Erie and other Great Lakes through the Welland Canal in the 20th century. These fish are predators of baby lake trout, who are themselves major predators in the lakes. These trout have not evolved to successfully avoid the alewives. In addition, alewife tissue consists of a chemical that breaks down an essential vitamin for the young trouts’ development.
    <br> <br> Pacific Salmon, a species that generates billions of dollars in fishing revenue annually in the Great Lakes, flourish on an alewife diet. Salmon were originally released in mass amounts into Lake Michigan in 1966 to control alewife populations, which led to their domination of the Great Lakes’ recreational fishing industry. This complicates matters because, while alewives are detrimental to the lake trout population, they also provide economic benefits through their relationship to salmon.
